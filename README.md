Implemention: 

   Using MQTT protocol, data of two water samples from two different water bodies will be collected using pH sensor, turbidity sensor.
Sensor Data of each water body will be collected by WiFi module and transferred to the third NodeMCU. Data collected in the water bodies 
will be stored in the cloud this will be done by third NodeMCU. By using the ML algorithms data will be analyzed to predict quality of water, 
and the same informed to the person to make water potable.
